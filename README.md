# TowerOffense

This is is the github repository for another test game project I am making. I am using github pages to host the WebGL build from unity, and then embedding that in a hosted webpage. No this is not efficient but I have no idea what I am doing. This way each game I make (fingers crossed!) can be a unique project on github, rather than parts of a larger project which would also be the website. They can also be played on their own!
